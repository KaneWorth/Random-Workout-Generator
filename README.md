# Random-Workout-Generator
A web-based tool that generates random workouts based on the user's preference for upper or lower body exercises.

This workout generator is only limited to upper body, and lower body exercise plan splits.

The rep ranges are currently 4-8, 8-12 and 12-20 respectively.

It was designed to allow users to quickly generate a random list of exercises for them to follow while at the gym. Handy if you can't be bothered to come up with your own workout.

It works by using the math.random code in javascript once a button is clicked, to generate a random exercise from each body part's array. Pretty simple.

If you contiune to press the same button it will contiune to generate a random list of exercises, incase you didn't like what it gave the first time around.
